# MotionPlanner
## Motion Planner for Self Driving Cars


The goal of this project will be to have a **functional motion planning stack** that can **avoid both static and dynamic obstacles** while tracking the center line of a lane, while also **handling stop signs.** To accomplish this, we will have to implement behavioral planning logic, as well as static collision checking, path selection, and velocity profile generation.
